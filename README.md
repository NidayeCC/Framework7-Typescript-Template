# Typework 7

## A template for Framework7 based on TypeScript, AngularJS, SASS and Grunt
Made with <3 by www.timo-ernst.net

## How to build

1) No complicated bower or yeoman stuff. Just get from Github.
2) Then, do `npm install` and then `grunt compile` to compile and copy everything from /src to /build. Default task for grunt is “watch” which you can use for auto-compile and -reload in the browser when you do changes in /src.

Make sure you have Node, grunt, gem and compass installed.

## Demo

To see the result just call `grunt compile` and then open index.html from `build` folder.

Or you can check this live demo in your browser that I built on top of this template: http://www.timo-ernst.net/2015/04/a-movie-list-demo-app-built-with-framework7-and-angular

## Get started coding

Good start points to dive into the code are:

- For HTML: src/index.dev.html
- For Scripts: src/ts/Typework7/init.ts
- For Styles: src/sass

## Credits & Links

- Template is based on this tutorial which is also a good place to start for Angular+TypeScript: https://kodeyak.wordpress.com/2014/02/12/angularjs-via-typescript-controllers/
