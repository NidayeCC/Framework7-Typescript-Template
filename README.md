# Typework 7

## A template for Framework7 based on TypeScript, AngularJS, SASS and Grunt

## How to build

No complicated bower or yeoman stuff. Just download and copy to a folder.

Then, call `grunt compile` to compile and copy everything from /src to /build.
Default task for grunt is "watch".

Make sure you have Node, grunt, gem and compass installed.

## Demo

To see the result just open index.html from dest/ folder.

## Get started coding

Good start points to dive into the code are:

- For HTML: src/index.dev.html
- For Scripts: src/ts/Typework7/init.ts
- For Styles: src/sass

## Credits & Links

- Template is based on this tutorial which is also a good place to start for Angular+TypeScript: https://kodeyak.wordpress.com/2014/02/12/angularjs-via-typescript-controllers/
